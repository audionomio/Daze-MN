# Daze-MN
A modernized fork of the Daze WordPress Theme by NordWood Themes — PHP 8+ compatible, Instagram Graph API, performance fixes, all demo code removed.

Daze is a beautiful masonry blog theme that hasn't been maintained since ~2019. This fork updates it for current WordPress and PHP versions while preserving the original design.

What's changed
- PHP 8+ compatibility — removed all extract() calls and deprecated functions
- Instagram Graph API — the carousel and grid widgets work again, using the official API with automatic token refresh
- Performance — conditional script loading, font-display: swap, removed unused jQuery UI
- Cleanup — ~600 lines of hardcoded demo code removed, Customizer frame-width bug fixed
- No visual changes — the theme looks exactly the same

Requirements
- WordPress 6.0+
- PHP 8.0+
- For Instagram widgets: a Meta Developer App + Business/Creator Instagram account
See CHANGELOG.md for a detailed list of every change and why it was made.
